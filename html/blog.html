        <h4>Exploring the Academic Journey and Insights </h4>
        <p>we believe campuses also have housing for students in buildings called dormitories and structures like libraries, study rooms and gymnasiums for students that live there. Each school offers many courses that students take to earn a degree. The person with the highest right to control and to command in a university is the rector, who governs 
            the university with the help of the party of vice-rectors and of other organs such as the social council and the governing body.
